            <p><strong>Dear Shinjini,</strong></p>
            
            <p>
                I wanted to do something special for your birthday, so I built this for you.
                I just wanted to say how much you mean to me...
            </p>
            
            <p>
                From the moment we met, you've brought so much joy and light into my life.
                Your smile brightens my darkest days, and your laughter is music to my ears.
            </p>

            <p>Happy Birthday Baby!</p>
